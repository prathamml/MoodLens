MoodLens is a project that focuses on facial emotion recognition. It uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and classify the emotions expressed in human faces.

Main Function Points
Face detection: The project uses the Haar Cascade algorithm to detect faces in an image or video stream.
Emotion classification: The project employs a deep learning model to classify the detected faces into different emotional states, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.
Real-time emotion detection: The project can perform emotion detection in real-time, making it suitable for applications that require immediate feedback on the user's emotional state.
Technology Stack
Python
OpenCV (for face detection)
TensorFlow (for deep learning model)
Keras (for deep learning model)
